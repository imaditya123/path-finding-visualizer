# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer (React.js)

A simple and interactive **pathfinding visualizer** built with **React.js**, designed to help users understand how popular algorithms like **Dijkstra**, **A\***, **BFS**, and **DFS** explore and find the shortest path on a grid.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive grid with draggable **start** and **end** nodes  
- Add/remove **walls** by clicking or dragging  
- Visualize algorithms:
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
  - A\* Search  
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Smooth animations showing visited nodes and shortest paths  
- Reset grid or clear paths instantly  
- Responsive UI

## 🎯 Usage

1. Select an algorithm from the menu.
2. Build your grid by placing walls.
3. Press Visualize to run the algorithm.
4. Watch the exploration and shortest path animate in real time!
